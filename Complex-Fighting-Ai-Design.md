Movement:
The AI will move to a player within its sight, if the AI's hp is more than 30 health lower (max health being 100) than its target it will head in another direction and or to a weaker player. The AI's speed is seven pixels per frame, which is 0.1 pixel slower that the players speed (7.1). Everything else is in sync with the player.

Tier:
Like the player there are three tiers each with a different type of weapon and skill set (Though this is an AI so yeah).
